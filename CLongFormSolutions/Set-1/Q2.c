/*
Intorducing functions, a bit more advanced and also logical operators have been introduced.
Also decided to introduce recursion (more advanced concept, but it is a bit more difficult, probably 
should add some hints for the solution).
Also introduced the concept of error handling -- shown in "Error: Please enter a non-negative number"
